## Email Samples on Different Topics

### Discussion

* > Please see my comment in line.
* When other team member raise another suggestion or solution you disagree, instead of arguing he's wrong, you can try to agree on his solution first with sincere example. Then raise your solution, talk about the difference between them and come out with a conclusion with category.
     
     > We agree that xxx is a good choice / idea when xxx. And it is perfect to do xxx. For example, xxx. This will xxx and will be a good choice.  
     But for this scenario xxx, it is more clean to just do xxx.  
    So to summerize, we would like to separate the two scenarios: 1. xxx. 2. xxx.
* During discussion email thread process, remember to occassionly thank the people discussing with you. This can ease the discussion tense and remind people that you are discussing to improve the product and not mean to aim anyone.
    > Thanks @people for lots of suggestions, especially the xxx. The suggestion really helps to understand and re-think more about the design of xxx.

* Need more info.
    
    > Thanks for the suggestions. Can you share more about the thoughts behind following ideas? Knowing the improvements we want to achieve with the ideas would be very helpful for us on detailed design. I also attached some technical details that may bring impact to the expected improvements.

* > Do you want to collect all the concerns and open issues, and then we can schedule a meeting to resolve them?
* > You mentioned other architectural concerns. **Let’s get them on the table.** Have you written them down somewhere?  Happy to review.
* > **On the flip side,** sharing credentials is considered an anti-pattern. 
* Share the current status of your process. What your team has decided and been working on.

    > To summarize current status: the xxx idea is great and we agree that we do sth. We’re actively working on the SDK design, and will share more details with sample code in next review meeting.
    
    > Thanks for the feedback and I'd like to share our updates and ideas to discuss.

        1.   
        2.  
    Need further discussion:  
        1.   
        2.  


* Ask other team for technical advice.

    > There’re some technical considerations and best practices that impacts our design. For example, xxx. This impacts the design of xxx. In the meanwhile, the existing xxx also follows similar practices. I’m not able to share all the considerations in the thread and apologize for the confusions caused.
* Greet new member join to discuss.

    > Hi xxx, Glad to talk with you. **To provide some background**, we’re working on the xxx.  
    I recommend we sit down with Bob who is the architect of xxx.  I'll brief him on the situation tomorrow and then set up a call with him so we can get the right design.  
    Thank you very much, Alan. Looking forward to talk with you and Bob.

* Sync the release plan with other team. Call out if there is any concern so you don't get blocked by other team.
    > Can you share the release plan of the xxx support? That would be very helpful to our planning. And for the coding experience, we currently would like to have xxx (techinical details). If you have the same scenario implementation, please also share with us.

* > Can you please **articulate**(明确说明) why specifically the xxx interface is not suitable for an xxx flow?  
    Can you please **articulate** the release plans for the xxx, and point us to the design doc and/or code in progress if possible?
