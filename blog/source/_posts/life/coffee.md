# Charming Coffee

## 


Commodity coffee VS Specialty Coffee

Expresso VS non-espresso

Coffee gets made three times.
It's first made at the farm, when cherries are harvested, and then they are processed and dried to become beans.
It is next made at the roastery, where beans go from green to brown, and roasters use their machines to balance out the flavors in the coffee, with flavors that are created by the roast.
And the last time it gets made is when it's made into a beverage, and this kind of gets all the credit cause this is what people see.
These are the three acts of its story.
